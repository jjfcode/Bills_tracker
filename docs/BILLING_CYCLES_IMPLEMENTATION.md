# Flexible Billing Cycles - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Feature Overview

The **Flexible Billing Cycles** feature has been successfully implemented in the Bills Tracker application. This advanced feature allows users to set and manage bills with various recurring patterns, from weekly subscriptions to annual memberships.

## ✅ Implemented Features

### Core Billing Cycles
- **Weekly**: Every 7 days (e.g., weekly cleaning service)
- **Bi-Weekly**: Every 14 days (e.g., bi-weekly newspaper delivery)
- **Monthly**: Every month (e.g., Netflix subscription, utilities)
- **Quarterly**: Every 3 months (e.g., quarterly tax payments)
- **Semi-Annually**: Every 6 months (e.g., car insurance)
- **Annually**: Every 12 months (e.g., domain registration, memberships)
- **One-Time**: Single payment with no recurrence (e.g., software license)

### Smart Date Handling
- ✅ **Month-end edge cases**: January 31st → February 28th/29th
- ✅ **Leap year support**: Proper handling of February 29th
- ✅ **Month length variations**: Handles 28, 29, 30, and 31-day months
- ✅ **Year rollover**: Seamless transitions across year boundaries

### User Experience
- ✅ **Interactive selection**: Menu-driven billing cycle selection
- ✅ **Color-coded display**: Different colors for each billing cycle type
- ✅ **Automatic advancement**: Due dates update automatically when bills are paid
- ✅ **Smart recurrence**: Recurring bills reset to "unpaid" with new due date
- ✅ **One-time completion**: One-time bills stay "paid" and don't recur

### Integration Features
- ✅ **Calendar view**: Upcoming bills displayed in calendar format
- ✅ **Search compatibility**: Search works with billing cycle information
- ✅ **Sort compatibility**: Sort bills by billing cycle type
- ✅ **Pagination support**: Large lists handled efficiently
- ✅ **Backup compatibility**: Billing cycle data included in backups

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Code Architecture
```python
class BillingCycle:
    WEEKLY = "weekly"
    BI_WEEKLY = "bi-weekly"
    MONTHLY = "monthly"
    QUARTERLY = "quarterly"
    SEMI_ANNUALLY = "semi-annually"
    ANNUALLY = "annually"
    ONE_TIME = "one-time"
```

### Key Functions
- `get_billing_cycle()`: Interactive cycle selection
- `calculate_next_due_date()`: Smart date advancement
- `add_months()`: Proper month arithmetic with edge case handling
- `get_billing_cycle_color()`: Color coding for visual feedback

### Data Structure
Each bill now includes:
```json
{
    "name": "Netflix Subscription",
    "due_date": "2025-01-15",
    "billing_cycle": "monthly",
    "web_page": "https://netflix.com",
    "login_info": "user@email.com",
    "paid": false
}
```

## 🚀 How to Use

### Adding a Bill with Billing Cycle
1. Run `python bills-tracker.py`
2. Choose "1. Add a bill"
3. Enter bill details (name, due date, website, login)
4. Select billing cycle from the menu:
   ```
   1. Weekly - Every 7 days
   2. Bi-Weekly - Every 14 days
   3. Monthly - Every month
   4. Quarterly - Every 3 months
   5. Semi-Annually - Every 6 months
   6. Annually - Every 12 months
   7. One-Time - One-time payment (no recurrence)
   ```

### Paying Bills
- When you pay a recurring bill, the system automatically:
  - Calculates the next due date based on the billing cycle
  - Resets the bill status to "unpaid" for the next cycle
  - Preserves all other bill information

- For one-time bills:
  - Bill stays marked as "paid"
  - No future due dates are calculated
  - Bill completion is permanent

### Viewing Bills
- Bills display with color-coded billing cycle indicators
- Due dates show smart urgency highlighting:
  - 🚨 Red: Overdue bills
  - 🔥 Yellow: Due today
  - ⚠️ Orange: Due within 3 days
  - 📅 Blue: Due later

## 📊 Real-World Examples

| Service Type | Billing Cycle | Example |
|--------------|---------------|---------|
| Streaming Services | Monthly | Netflix, Spotify, Disney+ |
| Utilities | Monthly | Electric, Gas, Water |
| Insurance | Semi-Annually | Car, Home, Life Insurance |
| Memberships | Annually | Gym, Professional Associations |
| Domains/Hosting | Annually | Domain registration, Hosting |
| Cleaning Services | Weekly | Housekeeping, Lawn care |
| Publications | Bi-Weekly | Newspapers, Magazines |
| Tax Payments | Quarterly | Estimated taxes, Business taxes |
| Software | One-Time | License purchases, Tools |

## 🧪 Testing

The implementation has been thoroughly tested with:

### Edge Case Testing
- ✅ End-of-month dates (Jan 31 → Feb 28/29)
- ✅ Leap year transitions (Feb 29 → Mar 29)
- ✅ Month length variations (31 → 30 day months)
- ✅ Year boundary crossings (Dec → Jan)

### Billing Cycle Testing
- ✅ All seven billing cycles tested with multiple date scenarios
- ✅ Payment simulation verified for each cycle type
- ✅ One-time vs. recurring behavior confirmed

### Integration Testing
- ✅ Backward compatibility with existing bills.json files
- ✅ Migration function for bills without billing_cycle field
- ✅ Search, sort, and pagination work with new data structure

## 🔄 Migration Support

The system includes automatic migration for existing bills:
- Bills without a `billing_cycle` field default to "monthly"
- No data loss during upgrades
- Seamless transition for existing users

## 📁 Files Modified

- `bills-tracker.py`: Core implementation with billing cycle logic
