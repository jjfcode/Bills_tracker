## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues

**"ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'colorama'"**
```bash
pip install colorama tqdm
```

**"pip: command not found"**
```bash
# On Windows, try:
python -m pip install colorama tqdm

# On macOS/Linux, ensure pip is installed:
sudo apt-get install python3-pip  # Ubuntu/Debian
brew install python3              # macOS with Homebrew
```

### Display Issues

**Colors not displaying properly:**
- **Windows**: The app automatically initializes colorama for Windows compatibility
- **Terminal Issues**: Try using Windows Terminal, Command Prompt, or PowerShell
- **Legacy Systems**: Update your terminal or command prompt for best results

**Screen not clearing properly:**
- **Windows**: Uses `cls` command - ensure command prompt supports it
- **Linux/Mac**: Uses `clear` command - should work on all standard terminals
- **Workaround**: Manually scroll up if clear doesn't work

**Pagination not working:**
- Check that your terminal window is large enough
- Ensure terminal supports cursor positioning
- Try resizing terminal window and restarting application

### Data Issues

**"Invalid date format" errors:**
- Use YYYY-MM-DD format exactly (e.g., 2025-07-15)
- Ensure month and day have leading zeros: 2025-07-05, not 2025-7-5
- Verify the date exists: February 30th is invalid

**Billing cycle issues:**
- Choose from the numbered menu options (1-7)
- If cycles seem wrong, check the due date calculation in bill details
- One-time bills won't advance dates when paid (this is correct behavior)

**Reminder periods not working:**
- Ensure reminder days are between 1-365
- Check that bills show "⏰ X days before" in bill display
- Use "Custom reminder periods" option in due bills menu

### Performance Issues

**Application runs slowly:**
- Large number of bills (100+) may cause slower pagination
- Consider cleaning up old, unnecessary bills
- Backup files are automatically managed (only 5 kept)

**Backup creation errors:**
- Check write permissions in the application directory
- Ensure sufficient disk space for backup files
- Backup directory will be created automatically if missing

**Memory issues with large datasets:**
- Pagination helps manage large bill lists
- Consider archiving very old bills to separate files
- Application is optimized for typical household bill counts (10-50 bills)

### File & Data Issues

**Bills.json file corrupted:**
- Application will automatically create a new empty file
- Restore from recent backup in `backups/` directory
- Choose the most recent backup file and rename it to `bills.json`

**Migration issues:**
- If bills don't show reminder periods, restart the application
- Migration happens automatically on first load after update
- Check that bills display "⏰ 7 days before" for migrated bills

**Search not finding bills:**
- Search is case-insensitive but requires partial matches
- Try searching with shorter terms or single words
- Use "Search all fields" option for broader results

### Error Messages Guide

**Critical Errors:**
- **❌ "This field is required"** - Enter a value or type 'cancel' to abort
- **❌ "Invalid date format"** - Use YYYY-MM-DD format exactly
- **❌ "Bill already exists"** - Choose a different name (case-insensitive check)
- **❌ "Invalid billing cycle selection"** - Choose a number from 1-7

**Warnings:**
- **⚠️ "No bills found"** - Add bills first before other operations
- **⚠️ "No search results"** - Try different search terms or broader criteria
- **⚠️ "No bills due"** - No bills match current reminder criteria (normal)

**Information Messages:**
- **ℹ️ "Starting with empty bills list"** - No existing data file found (normal for first run)
- **ℹ️ "Bills migrated to include..."** - Automatic upgrade successful (one-time message)
- **ℹ️ "Using pagination for large dataset"** - Normal behavior for 10+ items

### Recovery Procedures

**Complete Data Loss:**
1. Check `backups/` folder for recent backup files
2. Copy most recent backup: `cp backups/bills_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json bills.json`
3. Restart the application to load recovered data
4. Verify all bills and settings are correct

**Partial Data Corruption:**
1. Application will attempt automatic recovery
2. Check if some bills loaded correctly
3. Compare with backup files if needed
4. Manually edit `bills.json` if you're comfortable with JSON format

**Feature Not Working:**
1. Restart the application completely
2. Check that you're using the latest version
3. Verify all required libraries are installed: `pip list | grep colorama`
4. Try running with a fresh `bills.json` file to test functionality
